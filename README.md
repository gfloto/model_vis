# Neural Network Visualizations
Work in process library to visualize various aspect of neural networks

## Decision Cells
Selects random 2d hyper-plane in the input space. The decisions of a classifier are visualized using different colors. As time moves forward, the hyper-plane in rotated in the input space.
